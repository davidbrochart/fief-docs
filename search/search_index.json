It features impressive performance and top-notch developer experience. Actually, the Fief server itself is implemented with FastAPI! The Fief Python client provides tools to help you integrate Fief authentication in your FastAPI project. Let's see how to use them! Install the client Install the Fief client with the optional FastAPI dependencies: pip install \"fief-client[fastapi]\" Minimal example In this first example, we'll leverage the interactive documentation generated by FastAPI to perform the OAuth2 authentication. The goal here is just to show you how to protect your API route with a Fief access token . app.py from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI from fastapi.security import OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer from fief_client import FiefAccessTokenInfo , FiefAsync from fief_client.integrations.fastapi import FiefAuth fief = FiefAsync ( # (1)! \"https://example.fief.dev\" , \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" , \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\" , ) scheme = OAuth2AuthorizationCodeBearer ( # (2)! \"https://example.fief.dev/authorize\" , \"https://example.fief.dev/api/token\" , scopes = { \"openid\" : \"openid\" , \"offline_access\" : \"offline_access\" }, ) auth = FiefAuth ( fief , scheme ) # (3)! app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/user\" ) async def get_user ( access_token_info : FiefAccessTokenInfo = Depends ( auth . current_user ()), # (4)! ): return access_token_info Fief client instantiation As we showed in the standard Python section , we instantiate here a Fief client here with the base tenant URL and client credentials. Notice here that we use the FiefAsync class. FastAPI being an ASGI framework, it's always nice to take advantage of asyncio capabilities. OpenAPI security scheme FastAPI uses those security schemes to generate an interactive documentation showing the right interface to authenticate with the API. We use here a standard OAuth2 interface. Fief helper for FastAPI This is the helper doing the tedious work for you with FastAPI. All it needs is an instance of the Fief client and the scheme. current_user dependency This is where the magic happens: in pure FastAPI style, FiefAuth gives you a current_user dependency to check for the access token and optionally for required scopes. If everything goes well, you'll get a dictionary containing the ID of the user, the list of allowed scopes and the raw access token. And that's about it! Test it You can run this example just like you would do for any FastAPI app: uvicorn app:app Open http://localhost:8000/docs to access the interactive documentation. Let's try first the /user endpoint: We get an 401 error! That's expected: we are not authenticated yet ! Let's fix that: click on the Authorize button to start the authentication process. You'll need to provide your client ID and secret and select the scopes. Click on the Authorize button: you are redirected to the Fief login page. Upon successful login, you will be redirected back to the interactive documentation: a valid access token has been generated! You can now try the /user endpoint to check the result: Notice how the interactive documentation passed the access token in the Authorization header of the request! Besides, the response does contain the user ID, the list of allowed scopes and the access token itself. Summary With this example, we showed you how to use the current_user dependency to protect your API endpoints. However, we didn't implement routes to perform the OAuth2 authentication flow: we completely relied on the interactive documentation to do it for us.","title":"FastAPI"},{"location":"integrate/python/fastapi/#fastapi","text":"FastAPI is one of the fastest-growing Python web framework.

Notice here that we use the FiefAsync class. FastAPI being an ASGI framework, it's always nice to take advantage of asyncio capabilities. OpenAPI security scheme FastAPI uses those security schemes to generate an interactive documentation showing the right interface to authenticate with the API. We use here a standard OAuth2 interface. Fief helper for FastAPI This is the helper doing the tedious work for you with FastAPI. All it needs is an instance of the Fief client and the scheme. current_user dependency This is where the magic happens: in pure FastAPI style, FiefAuth gives you a current_user dependency to check for the access token and optionally for required scopes. If everything goes well, you'll get a dictionary containing the ID of the user, the list of allowed scopes and the raw access token. And that's about it!","title":"Minimal example"},{"location":"integrate/python/fastapi/#test-it","text":"You can run this example just like you would do for any FastAPI app: uvicorn app:app Open http://localhost:8000/docs to access the interactive documentation. Let's try first the /user endpoint: We get an 401 error! That's expected: we are not authenticated yet ! Let's fix that: click on the Authorize button to start the authentication process. You'll need to provide your client ID and secret and select the scopes. Click on the Authorize button: you are redirected to the Fief login page. Upon successful login, you will be redirected back to the interactive documentation: a valid access token has been generated! You can now try the /user endpoint to check the result: Notice how the interactive documentation passed the access token in the Authorization header of the request! Besides, the response does contain the user ID, the list of allowed scopes and the access token itself.","title":"Test it"},{"location":"integrate/python/fastapi/#summary","text":"With this example, we showed you how to use the current_user dependency to protect your API endpoints.
